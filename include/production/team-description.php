            artists and creators. Every artist has his own space. Our laboratories are visible and you can create with
            them in a process of free expression and fluid art.</h2>

            his true
            essence,
            and
            this also
            occurs
            through spaces in which the artistic drive can rise.</h2>
          <h2 id="al3" style="display: none;" class="noselect">Alkem represents the artistic and revolutionary wave of
            the search for
            connections between us
            and the
            universe, between us and the whole breath of existence. In Alkem visitors are guided on a journey without
            borders and without return.</h2>
